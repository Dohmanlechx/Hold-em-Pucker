# Hold'em Pucker
Simple Card Hockey game, Android app. Focus: Animations and techs that are important - Dagger 2, Navigation Graph and some more. A card game based on ice-hockey that I played frequently in my childhood against my dad. The biggest purpose of this project was to master in writing animations rather than actually trying to do a game as successful as possible.

There is also a big feature in this project - online support. Able to play over an internet connection against some random guy or a friend.
